# Home-security-and-Burglar-detecting-system
This is an Arduino based home security system.
In this arduino based system there is a keypad for password entry, one lcd screen I used 20*4, you can use 16*2 as per your need, just a single line of code chances, I have also used I2C interface for less usage of jumpers.
There is a buzzer that goes on when the ultrasonic sensor detects the distance too close, and the system asks for password entry, if password is right then the alarm goes off.
